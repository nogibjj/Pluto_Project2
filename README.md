# Overview
In my project2, I mainly create a bash script to acheive some data manipulation and automation, such as sort the dataset and truncate the big dataset to a small file that is easy to analyze. 

# Dataset
I continue to use the dataset about unemployment analysis from project 1, this [dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pantanjali/unemployment-dataset) is downloaded from Kaggle. 

# Bash Script
1. Truncate the big dataset to a small file
2. Analyze the head and tail of the new file data
3. Use more detailed search by some key word 
4. Compare different data and create them to a new txt file
5. Quickly sort the column names
